/****
Given an infinite number line. You start at 0 and can go either to the left or to the right. The condition is that in the ith move, youmust take i steps. Given a destination D , find the minimum number of steps required to reach that destination.

Example 1:

Input: D = 2
Output: 3
Explaination: The steps takn are +1, -2 and +3.
Example 2:

Input: D = 10
Output: 4
Explaination: The steps are +1, +2, +3 and +4.
Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minSteps() which takes the value D as input parameter and returns the minimum number of steps required to reach the dedstination D from 0.

Expected Time Complexity: O(D)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 â‰¤ D â‰¤ 10000
