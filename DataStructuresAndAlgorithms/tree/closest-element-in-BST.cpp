/****
Given a BST and an integer. Find the least absolute difference between any node value of the BST and the given integer.

Example 1:

Input:
        10
      /   \
     2    11
   /  \ 
  1    5
      /  \
     3    6
      \
       4
K = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: K=13. The node that has
value nearest to K is 11. so the answer
is 2
Example 2:

Input:
      8
    /   \
   1     9
    \     \
     4    10
    /
   3
K = 9
Output: 0
Explanation: K=9. The node that has
value nearest to K is 9. so the answer
is 0.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minDiff() that takes the root of the BST and an integer K as its input and returns the minimum absolute difference between any node value of the BST and the integer K.

Expected Time Complexity: O(Height of the BST).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Height of the BST).

Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes <= 100000

/*The Node structure is

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node *left;
    Node *right;

    Node(int val) {
        data = val;
        left = right = NULL;
    }
};
*/

// Return the minimum absolute difference between any tree node and the integer K
int minDiff(Node *root, int K)
{
    //Your code here
    if(!root) return INT_MAX;

    int ld = minDiff(root->left, K);

    int rd = minDiff(root->right, K);

    return min(min(ld, rd), abs(K-root->data));
}
