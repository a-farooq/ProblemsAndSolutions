/****
Given a Binary Tree of size N and an integer K. Print all nodes that are at distance k from root (root is considered at distance 0 from itself). Nodes should be printed from left to right. If k is more that height of tree, nothing should be printed.

For example, if below is given tree and k is 2. Output should be 4 5 6.

          1
       /     \
     2        3
   /         /   \
  4        5    6 
     \
      8

Example 1:
Input:
K = 0
      1
    /   \
   3     2
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input:
K = 3
        3
       /
      2
       \
        1
      /  \
     5    3
Output: 5 3

Your Task:
You don't have to take input. Complete the function Kdistance() that accepts root node and k as parameter and return the value of the nodes that are at a distance k from the root. (The values are returned as vector<int> in cpp, as ArrayList<Integer> in java and list in python)
Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Height of the Tree).

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10Ë†4
0 <= K <= 30

struct Node
{

// function should print the nodes at k distance from root
vector<int> Kdistance(struct Node *root, int k)
{
    vector<int> res;
    if(!root) return res;

    if(k == 0) {
        res.push_back(root->data);
        return res;
    }
    res = Kdistance(root->left, k-1);
    vector<int> tmp = Kdistance(root->right, k-1);
    res.insert(res.end(), tmp.begin(), tmp.end());

    return res;
